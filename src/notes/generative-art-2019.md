This year I continued to explore generative art. Unfortunately, not that much that I wanted: in the beginning of the year I was making at least one sketch every day. Then once a week, than once in a while. However, here are some results to remind myself that I need to commit more efforts next year.

- Build second version of my generative art toolkit as a wrapper for [p5.js](). First one from 2018 was built as a wrapper around Java [Processing library]() and lacks some important feature: quick feedback. I used Kotlin/JS technology for compiling Kotlin code into js file that was hot-reloaded in browser. This system ment to be experimental just to start hacking and doing art.

- Next version is built as a library agnostics toolkit for generative art with sketch-as-a-data approach and client-server implementation to fake hot-reload. New tool is decomposed into different modules so it'll be easier to change and/or refactor them one-by-one.

- Dared to publish two works on [/r/generative](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/) (one of them was used as a subreddit banner for december, yay!) and in my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DeadArtSpace/).



Here are some highlights:

## ':: you_are_not_alone ::' (November)

  - Somebody gifted me a reddit gold for this.
  - [/u/kritzikratzi](https://www.reddit.com/user/kritzikratzi/) pointed me that this sketch looks like some [Vera Molnar](http://www.veramolnar.com/) [works](http://dam.org/artists/phase-one/vera-molnar/artworks-bodies-of-work/-des-ordres). I read more about the artist and decided to call the new version of my toolkit "Vera" as a tribute to Vera Molnar works.

After seeing Vela Molnar works I've decided to add colors to my sketch as well.
